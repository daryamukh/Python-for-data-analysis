# Python for data analysis

This code was prepared by me during the conduct of a webinar on the educational platform Netology.
 

## We will learn how to:

1. Identify null values and duplicates
2. Aggregate data (similar to SQL 😏)
3. Sort data
4. Build pivot tables (similar to Excel 😏)
5. Merge dataframes
6. Create simple graphs

## This will help us: 

1. Identify the most loyal customers
2. Segment products by cost
3. Build retention across cohorts
